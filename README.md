# Vehicle_Rental_Website

A Vehicle rental system is a software application that is used to store, manage, and 
retrieve data related to vehicles available for renting and already booked. This type of system 
is used by businesses and organizations that need to keep track of information about 
vehicles, such as their vehicles booked status and customer details and basically used as a 
platform for their customers to book vehicles. One of the main reasons for using an rental 
system is to improve the efficiency of managing and retrieving vehicle information. Data in a 
central location, it becomes much easier to search for and retrieve the information, rather 
than having to manually look. This saves a lot of time and effort, especially for organizations 
that have a large number of vehicles and bookings in their inventory.

The oracle Database 11g express is used for the database in the webpage. It is a
database system where we create table by performing the SQL queries and insert data into
the tables using SQL commands. And we connect this database to our front end webpage to
where the data need to be printed or represented. For connecting oracle to the frontend part 
we are going to use Django with python as platform.
We have named our system as Travel Buddy.
